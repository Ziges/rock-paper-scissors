# rock-paper-scissors challenge

***
In this learning challenge I built a simple rock-paper-scissors game using mainly Javascript for the game behaviour, DOM queries, functions, methods, conditionals & other javascript functionalities
in order to make the game interactive for the user. The basic structure and styling is made with HTML and vanilla CSS.
